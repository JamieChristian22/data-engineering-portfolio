# Architecture Diagrams

This folder contains architecture diagrams used throughout the **Data
Engineering Portfolio**.

These visuals are designed to mirror real-world data platform
documentation found in professional engineering environments (e.g.,
architecture reviews, design docs, technical presentations).

## 📌 Hero Architecture Diagram

**File:**\
`hero-architecture.png`

**Purpose:**\
This is the primary system-level architecture diagram displayed at the
top of the root portfolio README. It represents the end-to-end data
engineering workflow demonstrated across projects.

It visualizes:

-   Data Sources (SaaS, APIs, databases, files)\
-   Ingestion patterns (batch, micro-batch, CDC)\
-   Storage layers (raw, staging, warehouse/lakehouse)\
-   Transformation and modeling (dbt, SCD2, marts)\
-   Serving layer (analytics tables, BI outputs)\
-   Data quality & validation\
-   Orchestration & CI/CD concepts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Why this exists

In professional environments, diagrams like this are used for:

-   Architecture reviews\
-   Stakeholder communication\
-   Onboarding new engineers\
-   Technical documentation\
-   Design decision justification

This folder simulates that real-world documentation practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔮 Future additions

This folder may also include:

-   Per-project architecture diagrams\
-   Data model diagrams (ERDs)\
-   Pipeline flow diagrams\
-   System interaction diagrams\
-   Cloud-specific architecture variants (AWS/GCP/Snowflake)\
-   Dark-mode versions
