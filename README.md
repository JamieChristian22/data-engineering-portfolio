Job-ready **Data Engineering portfolio** showcasing both **traditional data engineering** and **AI data engineering pipelines** built with **Python and SQL**.

This repository demonstrates how modern data engineers design, build, validate, and operationalize data pipelines — from core ETL workflows to AI-enabled enrichment, semantic search, and data reliability monitoring.

---

## 📌 Portfolio Overview

This portfolio is intentionally split into **two categories** to reflect real industry roles.

### 🔹 Traditional Data Engineering
- ETL / ELT pipelines  
- Data modeling & transformations  
- Analytics-ready datasets  
- SQL-first outputs  

### 🔹 AI Data Engineering
- AI-driven data enrichment  
- Semantic search pipelines  
- Data quality, drift & anomaly monitoring  
- Production-style reliability workflows
